About
=======

This library provides a set of annotations for JSP tag classes and functions. 

Usage
=======

Annotate tag classes with the @JspTag class-level annotation and add @JspAttribute to each attribute setter:

@JspTag(name = "mytag", bodyContent = JSP)
class MyTag extends BodyTagSupport {
      private String myattribute;

      @JspAttribute(required = true)
      public void setMyattribute(String value) {
      	     myattribute = value;
      }     
}

Annotate public static methods to be used as EL functions with @JspFunction:

class MyFunctions {
      @JspFunction(name = "mysum")
      public static int sum(int a, int b) {
      	     return a + b;
      }     
}
