About
=======

This Ant task generates tag library descriptors (.tld files) from annotated tag classes (see the annotations module) and JSP 2 tag files.

Usage
=======

First, add a plugin execution and specify basic taglib properties - short name, uri, and version as well as the packages to scan for tag classes and functions.

<plugin>
  <groupId>com.vecna</groupId>
  <artifactId>taglib-metadata-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <shortName>test-taglib</shortName>
    <uri>http://webapp.test.org/test-taglib</uri>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packages>
      <package>org.test.webapp.tags</package>
    </packages>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>taglib</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>

By default, the plugin will bind to the process-classes phase. Other defaults are:
* directory scanned for JSP 2.0 .tags - src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/tags
* directory where the .tld is written - target/generated-web-resources/WEB-INF

You will also need to configure the WAR plugin to pick up the .tld:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <webResources>            
      <resource>
        <directory>src/main/webapp</directory>
        <filtering>true</filtering>              
      </resource>
      <resource>
        <directory>${project.build.directory}/generated-web-resources</directory>
      </resource>
    </webResources>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
